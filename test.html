            <h1>Our Test</h1>
            <p>
                Our Neurocognitive Screening test uses various question-types to better 
                evaluate the 5 skills that comprise cognition. 
            </p>

                <h2>Comprehension</h2>
                <p>
                    Determines an individual’s ability to understand and respond 
                    to instructions. For example, this could be to spell words forwards and backwards. 
                    If someone spells a word forwards when instructions clearly state to spell 
                    backwards, the person may have been unable to comprehend the task’s directions.                
                </p>

            <div class="test">
                <h2>Perception</h2>
                <p>
                    Evaluates the individual’s ability to identify and distinguish 
                    between sensory information. Our test mainly evaluates visual and auditory 
                    perception, testing users with the help of images and recordings. If an 
                    individual was unable to identify an image or recording, he or she may have 
                    an impaired perception.      
                </p>

            <div class="test">
                <h2>Motor Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Assess the user’s ability to physically respond to cues, 
                    along with the time associated with completing the task. For example, 
                    a user may be asked to press a button. If unable to press the button 
                    in a certain time period, the individual’s motor skills may be impaired.

            <div class="test">
                <h2>Memory</h2>
                <p>
                    Determines the user’s ability to retain and recall information 
                    that may be presented in a variety of formats. A person who cannot recall 
                    information may display memory impairment, a common symptom of many 
                    neurodegenerative diseases.

            <div class="test">
                <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
                <p>
                    Assesses the user’s ability to answer basic questions 
                    involving numerical/language skills. These questions also require 
                    elements of comprehension. A user who is unable to correctly answer a 
                    question may possess poor problem-solving skills.
