                <h2>The Fight Against Neurodegenerative Disease</h2>
                <p>
                    One in ten people over the age of 65 have Alzheimer’s Disease and 
                    other forms of dementia. That comes out to 44 million people in the 
                    world who are afflicted. By 2050, healthcare costs for dementia in the US 
                    alone could rise to $1.1 trillion, over 325% more than what they are now. 
                    In a future where the average lifespan increases, risks for neurodegenerative 
                    disease will only go up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                        But there are ways we can help. Early detection of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, 
                        Huntington’s, and other neurodegenerative diseases may greatly assist in 
                        patient care. At Cognitive, we aim to use the results of our Neurocognitive 
                        Screening test to better evaluate cognitive function through simple tasks 
                        representative of cognitive health.

                <h2>Putting your health in your hands</h2>
                <p>
                    Patient care can be confusing even for healthcare 
                    professionals, so why should it be expected to be 
                    any different for patients? A 2009 study showed that the 
                    language that doctors and patients used was radically different, 
                    even stating that many patients did not truly understand the 
                    language involved in their treatment. With the increasing rate of 
                    medical innovation, the gap between patients and doctors is ever-important. 
                    This gap presents the need for patient-supplements that allow for patients 
                    to evaluate themselves and understand their own health. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cognitive is one of the first innovators in a movement that seeks 
                    to radically transform healthcare by returning patient care back to 
                    the hands of the patient. Our goals as a company are to promote self-care 
                    through our app, the first neurocognitive diagnosis tool available on 
                    mobile devices. We believe that our commitment to self-care will help in 
                    the early diagnosis of millions of patients with cognitive impairment in the future.

                <p>
                    The Cognitive Neurocognitive Screening Diagnosis Tool is a 
                    patient supplement that allows patients to evaluate their cognitive 
                    abilities through simple tasks. While the test provides a metric to 
                    evaluate cognitive function, it cannot determine whether a patient has a 
                    disease like Alzheimer’s, for example. The test is not liable for any false 
                    negatives/positives that are presented through results.
